# Jozwald.tk
My second major personal website from my time as a Junior in High school! It was live online from ~July 2017 - ~March 2018.

## Background
After the trainwreck that was [Joswald.com](https://github.com/James-Oswald/Jozwald.com) was taken down when my ISP discontinued their free website package, I was left without a domain and decided to start fresh by hosting my own brand new web server on a Raspberry PI in my room. I used the infamous .tk free domain name as a placeholder till I could buy back Jozwald.com, which I never ended up doing. 

For design I wanted something sleek and professional looking that I could design all myself with just pure CSS and HTML and no static site generator. I ended up settling on an interesting format, Black navbar on top, white page, and one of four randomly selected gradient highlight colors for the navbar highlights and sides. The end result was my proudest design ever at the time, a very sleek looking modern website.

By the time this was live I had had a lot more experience with javascript and was very interested in the mathematical applications of programming, the projects posted to this site reflect that, the two main things being a graphing calculator and a mandelbrot set generator.

## Some pages, screenshots, and history

### Home

As described above, the homepage was a masterpiece to me at the time I made it. It was so exciting to be able to make something so stylish without relying on a site generator by just using pure CSS and HTML. 

The contents of the homepage are comedic ramblings complaining about how the old Joswald.com was taken down by my ISP. Many of these jokes (such as the reference to the FBI being behind it) were hilarious in jokes for me and my 11th grade friends. 

You can also see that the title of the page was joswald.io, which seems to have been the new name I was set on at the time, which of course, I also never obtained. 

### Mandelbrot

This was an interesting project, I remember being blown away when seeing someone generate the mandelbrot set with JS on an HTML 5 canvas for the first time, this project took that algorithm for generating it and adding controls to allow the user to change the number of steps, zoom, and center to zoom into. All of these little features made a big difference and this was actually a rather popular application that was passed around my highschool for everyone to gawk at.  

### Graph

This graphing application was one of my favorite projects and inspired a whole host of other graphing applications that followed, including my [Pi-Day-2018 Project](https://github.com/James-Oswald/Fourier-Transformation-PI-Day-2018). It allowed users to graph regular, polar, and parametric functions on an HTML 5 canvas. I actually used this as my main graphing application for a month or so before I discovered Desmos.
